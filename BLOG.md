# DroneZ: Training LLMs to Operate Drone Delivery Fleets with OpenEnv

## Problem

Drone delivery is not just a pathfinding problem. Real delivery operations involve urgent orders, shifting no-fly zones, bad weather, failed drops, charging congestion, battery risk, and heterogeneous drone fleets.

DroneZ turns that operational layer into an OpenEnv-style reinforcement learning environment.

## Why Fleet Control Is Hard

A mission controller must make tradeoffs over time. Sending the fastest drone may drain battery. Completing one normal order may delay a medical order. Flying through a risky sector may complete delivery faster, but creates regulatory and safety cost. These are exactly the kinds of sequential decisions that static prompt-response evaluation does not capture well.

## Why This Is An OpenEnv / RL Environment

DroneZ exposes the core environment loop:

1. `reset` starts a fresh scenario.
2. The agent observes fleet, order, sector, charger, and disruption state.
3. The agent emits one structured JSON action.
4. `step` executes the action and advances the simulator.
5. The environment returns reward, done status, and the next observation.
6. `state` exposes the current environment state for runtime clients.

The agent is not doing low-level flight control. It is acting as a mission-level fleet operations controller.

## Action Space

DroneZ supports actions such as:

- `assign_delivery`
- `reroute`
- `return_to_charge`
- `reserve_charger`
- `prioritize_order`
- `attempt_delivery`
- `fallback_to_locker`
- `hold_fleet`
- `resume_operations`

## Reward Design

Positive reward components include successful delivery, urgent delivery success, deadline completion, safe rerouting, recovery from disruption, battery-safe operation, fleet utilization, regulatory compliance, and successful locker fallback.

Negative reward components include invalid actions, missed deadlines, failed delivery attempts, critical battery events, unsafe zone entry, unnecessary reroutes, abandoned urgent orders, idle fleet behavior, charging misuse, and loop/no-progress behavior.

## Anti-Reward-Hacking Safeguards

DroneZ uses layered safeguards:

- invalid actions are penalized and capped
- episode actions are capped independently from simulator horizon
- safety reroutes are rewarded separately and not double-penalized
- deadline misses are counted once when a deadline is crossed
- reward breakdowns are exported for audit
- deterministic demo traces allow manual inspection

## Evaluation Results

Current deterministic evaluation ranks:

`improved > heuristic > random > naive`

Demo scenario:

| Policy | Reward | Normalized Score | Deliveries | Urgent Successes | Safety Violations | Invalid Actions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| improved | 89.0 | 0.5861 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| heuristic | 32.0 | 0.2889 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 0 |
| random | -162.5 | 0.0100 | 2 | 1 | 33 | 0 |
| naive | -607.5 | 0.0100 | 0 | 0 | 72 | 0 |

The improved policy does not claim to be a trained LLM. It is a deterministic reference controller that demonstrates what better behavior should look like: same delivery count as heuristic in the demo, but with safety violations reduced from 8 to 0.

## Current Honest Training Status

The repository includes smoke and dry-run training paths, plus a Colab notebook/script path for TRL/GRPO. Real GRPO/Unsloth training has not yet been run in this repo.

Current claim:

`Deterministic improved policy beats baselines. GRPO/Unsloth training pipeline is prepared and dry-run validated.`

Future claim after real training:

`A trained model improves over its pre-training baseline`, only if real `eval_before`, `eval_after`, and training plots are produced.

## Demo Replay UI

The browser replay UI uses real JSON traces from the environment. It shows sectors, drones, orders, hazards, reward evolution, recent events, and reward breakdowns. It is not a disconnected animation.

Run locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:8080/demo_ui/index.html`

On Hugging Face Space, use:

`https://krishna2521-dronez-openenv.hf.space/demo/index.html`

## Deployment

DroneZ is prepared for Docker-based Hugging Face Spaces:

- Space repo: `https://huggingface.co/spaces/Krishna2521/dronez-openenv`
- Runtime URL: `https://krishna2521-dronez-openenv.hf.space`
- API docs: `/docs`
- Health check: `/health`

## Future Work

- run real GRPO/Unsloth training on Colab or hackathon compute
- add trained-model before/after metrics
- wire deployment profiles into scenario-specific fleet composition
- add more generated scenarios and curriculum stages
- expand the replay UI into side-by-side baseline vs improved playback
