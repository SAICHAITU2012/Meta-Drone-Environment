# DroneZ Pitch Pack

## 30-Second Pitch

DroneZ is an OpenEnv environment where an LLM learns to operate a fleet of delivery drones at the mission-control level. Instead of flying a single drone, it must assign deliveries, reroute around hazards, manage battery and charging, handle failed drops, and prioritize urgent orders under real operational constraints.

## 60-Second Pitch

Most drone demos are about flight. Ours is about operations. DroneZ simulates what actually makes delivery systems hard: dynamic weather, shifting no-fly zones, urgent orders, charger contention, battery risk, failed deliveries, and a heterogeneous fleet. We built it as a step-by-step OpenEnv environment so an LLM agent can act inside it, get reward feedback, and improve. We also built deterministic traces and a replay UI so judges can see not only the score change, but exactly what the controller decided and why.

## 2-Minute Stage Pitch

DroneZ tackles a real capability gap in LLM agents: persistent operational control in a dynamic world. The agent is not answering one prompt. It is repeatedly observing a logistics system, deciding an action, seeing the consequences, and adapting. That makes it a strong OpenEnv problem.

Our environment models a professional drone-delivery control room. The agent sees fleet state, order backlog, sector hazards, no-fly zones, charger occupancy, and recent disruptions. It can assign drones, reroute flights, send drones to charge, hold a risky zone, fall back to lockers, and recover from failed drops.

The reward system is decomposed and judge-explainable. We reward successful deliveries, urgent deliveries, meeting deadlines, safe reroutes, battery-aware operation, utilization, and recovery. We penalize missed deadlines, unsafe routing, battery critical states, invalid actions, unnecessary reroutes, charging misuse, and looping. We also explicitly guard against reward hacking by capping invalid actions and action count and by making safety reroutes distinct from unnecessary reroutes.

For evaluation, we compare random, naive, heuristic, and improved policies and export JSON, CSV, plots, and trace logs. For the demo, we replay real traces in the browser so you can see drones, sectors, hazards, orders, and rewards evolve over time. The point is not a pretty animation. The point is proving that the controller learned or improved inside a meaningful environment.

## Technical Judge Q&A

### What exactly is the agent learning?

It is learning operational sequencing under delayed consequences: which drone to assign, when to reroute, when to hold a zone, when to recover with lockers, and how to manage battery and deadlines across multiple assets.

### Why is this not just a toy drone simulator?

Because the hard part is not movement. The hard part is world state, disruptions, tradeoffs, and delayed reward. DroneZ is mission control, not joystick control.

### How do rewards avoid hacking?

- multiple reward components instead of one scalar proxy
- explicit invalid-action penalties
- action caps and invalid-action caps
- separate safety reroute reward so good safety behavior is not punished
- deterministic demo scenarios for manual inspection
- step and episode reward breakdowns for auditability

### How does this fit OpenEnv?

It uses the standard environment pattern:

- `reset`
- `step`
- `state`

It is packaged as a FastAPI app with an OpenEnv-style manifest and Docker entrypoint for Space deployment.

### Why do you have both heuristic and improved policies?

The heuristic is the stable hand-built baseline. The improved policy is the deterministic scripted judge-facing policy that shows what good operational behavior looks like before and after training infrastructure is run on hackathon compute.

### What would companies customize?

They would customize drone profiles, payload and battery constraints, routing preferences, compliance rules, charger layout, failure characteristics, cost assumptions, and mission priority types. We already added richer deployment profiles to support that direction.

## Non-Technical Explanation

Think of DroneZ like an air-traffic and logistics controller for delivery drones. The AI is deciding which drone should do which job, which jobs are urgent, which areas are temporarily unsafe, when a drone needs charging, and how to recover if a delivery goes wrong.

## What Did the Agent Learn?

- do not keep choosing invalid actions
- do not send drones into unsafe zones without adaptation
- use rerouting for safety, not randomly
- recover failed deliveries with locker fallback when recipients are unavailable
- keep the fleet moving instead of idling with pending work

## Why This Matters

If LLM agents are going to run real operational workflows, they need to learn to maintain state, react to changing constraints, and optimize over multiple competing objectives. DroneZ is a compact but realistic testbed for that.

## Five Likely Judge Questions

### 1. What exactly is trained?

The thing being trained is the mission-control policy: the model chooses one structured operational action at a time from the DroneZ observation, then gets the next observation and reward from the environment.

### 2. What is the observation / action / reward loop?

The loop is `reset -> observe fleet/orders/sectors/charging/events -> choose one JSON action -> environment executes -> reward + done + next observation -> repeat`.

### 3. Why is this OpenEnv and not just a simulator?

Because it is packaged as an environment with explicit `reset`, `step`, and `state`, a FastAPI runtime, Docker packaging, and an OpenEnv manifest. The simulator is only one layer; the project is built to be used inside an RL training loop.

### 4. What evidence shows improvement?

This repo currently shows deterministic improvement: `improved` beats `heuristic`, `random`, and `naive` on the exported benchmark artifacts, while keeping zero invalid actions and zero safety violations in the current sweep. Real GRPO training is prepared separately and should be added only after an actual run.

### 5. What remains after the hackathon?

The main post-hackathon step is running real GRPO / Unsloth training at larger scale, deploying the environment to a live HF Space, and expanding the configurable fleet profiles into customer-specific operational variants.
