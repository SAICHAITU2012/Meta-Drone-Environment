# DroneZ

DroneZ is an OpenEnv-style RL environment for training an LLM to act as a mission-level fleet operations controller for autonomous delivery drones.

## 1. Problem

Drone delivery does not fail because of pathfinding alone. Real operations break when urgent orders arrive late, weather shifts, no-fly zones move, batteries drain unevenly, recipients disappear, chargers back up, and the controller must continuously replan across a heterogeneous fleet.

DroneZ models that operational layer. The agent is not piloting a drone. It is deciding which drone should take which mission, when to reroute, when to hold a zone, when to send a drone to charge, and how to recover from failed drops.

## 2. Why This Is an OpenEnv / RL Problem

DroneZ is designed around the exact loop OpenEnv is meant to standardize:

1. Reset into a fresh logistics scenario.
2. Observe structured fleet, order, city, and disruption state.
3. Choose one action at a time.
4. Let the environment advance and return reward, done, and next observation.
5. Improve the policy through repeated interaction, not static labels alone.

The environment is stateful, partially observable, multi-step, and reward-driven. That makes it a strong fit for OpenEnv and for verifiable RL pipelines such as GRPO.

## 3. Theme Fit

- Primary: Theme `#3.1` World Modeling / Professional Tasks
- Secondary: Theme `#1` Multi-Agent Interactions
- Optional: Theme `#2` Long-Horizon Planning

## 4. Environment Overview

The agent controls a heterogeneous fleet:

- `fast_light`
- `heavy_carrier`
- `long_range_sensitive`
- `relay`

Each episode tracks:

- fleet battery, position, assignment, route, and risk
- order priority, deadlines, availability, fallback options, and retries
- sector weather, congestion, no-fly state, and manual holds
- charging occupancy and reservations
- scripted and stochastic disruptions

### Reset / Step / State

- `reset(task_id)` starts a scenario
- `step(action)` advances the world
- `state` is exposed through the HTTP runtime at `GET /sessions/{id}/state`

## 5. Observation Space

Each observation includes:

- fleet states
- order queue
- city sectors
- charging stations
- recent events
- warnings
- action reminder
- summary string for human-readable debugging

## 6. Action Space

Current supported actions:

- `assign_delivery`
- `reroute`
- `return_to_charge`
- `reserve_charger`
- `delay_order`
- `prioritize_order`
- `swap_assignments`
- `attempt_delivery`
- `fallback_to_locker`
- `hold_fleet`
- `resume_operations`

## 7. Termination Conditions

Episodes terminate when:

- all orders are resolved
- horizon is reached
- no viable drones remain
- invalid action cap is reached
- action cap is reached

The environment and evaluator both enforce safety caps so policy bugs cannot stall the demo.

## 8. Reward Design

### Positive components

- `delivery_success`
- `urgent_delivery_success`
- `deadline_met`
- `safe_reroute`
- `disruption_recovery`
- `battery_safe_operation`
- `efficient_assignment`
- `fleet_utilization`
- `regulatory_compliance`
- `successful_locker_fallback`

### Negative components

- `invalid_action`
- `missed_deadline`
- `failed_delivery_attempt`
- `battery_critical`
- `unsafe_zone_entry`
- `unnecessary_reroute`
- `abandoned_urgent_order`
- `idle_with_pending_orders`
- `overloaded_assignment`
- `charging_misuse`
- `loop_or_no_progress`

### Anti-Reward-Hacking Safeguards

- invalid actions are penalized and capped
- action count is capped independently from environment ticks
- safety reroutes are not double-penalized as unnecessary reroutes
- deadline misses only count once when a deadline is first crossed
- deterministic demo scenarios make judge replays reproducible
- reward breakdowns are logged for every step and episode
- normalized scores are clamped into `[0.01, 0.99]`

## 9. Current Policies

- `random`: deterministic pseudo-random baseline
- `naive`: simple greedy controller
- `heuristic`: stable hand-built baseline
- `improved`: deterministic scripted policy for judge-facing demo and replay

## 10. Evaluation

Generated artifacts:

- `artifacts/results/policy_comparison.json`
- `artifacts/results/policy_comparison.csv`
- `artifacts/traces/demo_random_trace.json`
- `artifacts/traces/demo_naive_trace.json`
- `artifacts/traces/demo_heuristic_trace.json`
- `artifacts/traces/demo_improved_trace.json`
- `artifacts/plots/reward_comparison.png`
- `artifacts/plots/delivery_success_comparison.png`
- `artifacts/plots/invalid_actions_comparison.png`

Current deterministic comparison snapshot:

| Task | Random | Naive | Heuristic | Improved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Easy reward | -278.0 | -315.5 | -154.0 | **35.0** |
| Medium reward | -1231.5 | -1259.5 | -439.5 | **-77.0** |
| Hard reward | -2014.0 | -1969.5 | -564.5 | **-215.5** |
| Demo reward | -162.5 | -607.5 | 32.0 | **89.0** |

Current aggregate story:

- `improved` has the best mean reward and best normalized score
- `improved` keeps `0` invalid actions and `0` safety violations across the sweep
- `heuristic` completes more deliveries, but does so with much higher safety cost
- this repo currently proves deterministic policy improvement, not trained-model improvement

Demo headline:

| Policy | Reward | Normalized Score | Deliveries | Urgent Successes | Safety Violations | Invalid Actions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| improved | **89.0** | **0.5861** | 2 | 1 | **0** | 0 |
| heuristic | 32.0 | 0.2889 | 2 | 1 | 8 | 0 |
| random | -162.5 | 0.0100 | 2 | 1 | 33 | 0 |
| naive | -607.5 | 0.0100 | 0 | 0 | 72 | 0 |

Run them with:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate_policies.py
python scripts/generate_demo_trace.py --task demo --policy all
python scripts/generate_plots.py
```

## 11. Training Pipeline

This repo currently includes:

- `scripts/train_grpo.py --mode smoke`
- `scripts/train_grpo.py --mode dry-run`
- `scripts/train_grpo.py --mode trl-template`
- `scripts/train_grpo_colab.py`
- `notebooks/train_dronez_grpo_colab.ipynb`
- `COLAB_TRAINING.md`

What is honest right now:

- the smoke mode uses the actual environment loop locally
- the dry-run mode prepares the real prompt/action interface and writes reference artifacts
- the GRPO path is a dependency-gated Colab / hackathon-compute template
- no fake trained-model claims or fake GRPO results are included

Honesty box:

- Current measured improvement in this repo: deterministic `improved` policy vs baselines
- Real GRPO / Unsloth training: pipeline ready, but not yet executed here
- Update this section only after a real run produces `eval_before`, `eval_after`, and training plots

Recommended next step onsite:

1. Install train extras: `pip install -e .[train]`
2. Run `python scripts/train_grpo_colab.py --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --tasks easy,medium,demo --output-dir artifacts/training` on Colab or hackathon compute
3. Save real reward curves and before/after comparisons back into `artifacts/`
4. Replace the honesty box with real training evidence only after the run finishes

## 12. Visual Demo

The replay UI is trace-driven and intentionally lightweight.

- UI entry: `demo_ui/index.html`
- Data source: `artifacts/traces/*.json`
- Suggested local run:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open:

- `http://localhost:8080/demo_ui/index.html`
- HF Space after deployment: `https://krishna2521-dronez-openenv.hf.space/demo/index.html`

The UI replays real environment traces and shows:

- city sectors and hazards
- charging stations
- active drone locations and paths
- pending and urgent orders
- reward and status panels
- recent event log

Suggested stage flow:

1. load `random` or `naive`
2. show poor reward and unsafe behavior
3. switch to `heuristic`
4. switch to `improved`
5. point at the reward breakdown and policy snapshot panels
6. finish on the reward comparison plot

## 13. Local Setup

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest -q
python inference.py --task demo --policy heuristic --max-steps 8 --summary-only
python inference.py --task demo --policy improved --summary-only
python scripts/evaluate_policies.py
python scripts/generate_demo_trace.py --task demo --policy all
python scripts/generate_plots.py
python scripts/train_grpo.py --mode smoke
python scripts/train_grpo.py --mode dry-run
```

## 14. Server / Docker / HF Deployment

Run locally:

```bash
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

State endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /tasks`
- `POST /reset`
- `POST /step`
- `GET /state`
- `POST /sessions`
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/reset`
- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/state`
- `POST /sessions/{session_id}/step`

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t dronez .
docker run --rm -p 8000:7860 dronez
```

See `DOCKER_TESTING.md` for curl checks. The root Dockerfile listens on `7860` by default because Hugging Face Docker Spaces require that port.

## 15.1 What Is Already Proven

- The environment runs locally.
- `pytest -q` passes.
- `openenv validate` passes.
- Evaluation artifacts regenerate.
- The trace-driven demo UI replays real environment logs.
- Deterministic `improved` policy beats random, naive, and heuristic baselines on reward/normalized score.

## 15.2 What Requires External Compute

- Real GRPO / TRL / Unsloth training has not been run in this repo.
- Run the Colab notebook or `scripts/train_grpo_colab.py` on GPU compute.
- Add trained-model evidence only after real `eval_before`, `eval_after`, and training plots exist.

## 16. Drone Customization

Internal archetypes remain stable for training, while richer deployment profiles live in:

- `configs/fleet_profiles.yaml`

Deployment profiles include:

- `light_food_delivery_drone`
- `medical_priority_drone`
- `heavy_package_drone`
- `long_range_rural_drone`
- `urban_fast_drone`
- `relay_support_drone`

Each profile includes speed, payload, battery, charging, range, energy use, failure modifier, compliance, and cost fields so companies can map the simulator to their own real fleets.

## 17. Known Limitations

- Real GRPO training is scaffolded and Colab-ready, but not yet executed in this repo
- The replay UI is static HTML/JS, not yet a full React build
- Deployment profile selection is represented in config but not yet fully wired into task-specific fleet composition
- The environment is intentionally mission-level, not physics-level

## 18. Future Work

- run real GRPO / Unsloth training on hackathon compute
- add per-task replay traces for all scenarios
- wire deployment profile selection directly into environment reset
- publish HF Space and remote OpenEnv client package
- add richer browser animation and side-by-side baseline vs improved replay
